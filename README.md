üîß Technical Details
Architecture

Frontend: Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
Backend: FastAPI with Python
NLP: spaCy with biomedical entity recognition
Synonym Resolution: PubChem, UniProt, BioPortal APIs
Deployment: Vercel (serverless)

Data Sources Integration

OpenTargets: GraphQL API for drug-target-disease data
ClinicalTrials.gov: REST API for clinical trials
PubChem: Chemical compound synonyms
UniProt: Protein/target information
BioPortal: Disease ontology mapping

Synonym Handling
The tool automatically handles different naming conventions:

Drugs: Imatinib ‚Üî Gleevec ‚Üî CHEMBL941
Targets: JAK2 ‚Üî ENSG00000096968 ‚Üî P52333
Diseases: Breast Cancer ‚Üî EFO_0000305

üß™ Testing
Run the validation tests to ensure everything works:
bash# Test all functionality
python tests/validate.py

# Test specific query
python tests/validate.py --test "Imatinib"

# Test against live deployment
python tests/validate.py --url "https://your-app.vercel.app"
üìä Example Queries and Expected Results
Query: "List diseases in Phase-2 for Imatinib"
Expected Results:

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (Phase 2)
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (Phase 2)
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Phase 2)

Query: "List toxicities for Dasatinib"
Expected Results:

Pleural Effusion (Grade 3, 28% frequency)
Thrombocytopenia (Grade 4, 15% frequency)
Neutropenia (Grade 3, 21% frequency)

üöÄ Deployment
Deploy to Vercel

Push to GitHub

bashgit add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main

Deploy with Vercel

bashnpm install -g vercel
vercel --prod

Set Environment Variables (in Vercel dashboard)


BIOPORTAL_API_KEY (if using BioPortal)
PYTHONPATH=/var/task

Manual Deployment

Build the application

bashnpm run build

Deploy backend (to your preferred platform)
Deploy frontend (to Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

üîç Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"spaCy model not found"
bashpython -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
"No results found"

Try synonyms (e.g., "Gleevec" instead of "Imatinib")
Check spelling
Verify database selection

API timeouts

Reduce number of selected databases
Try simpler queries first

CSV export not working

Ensure papaparse is installed: npm install papaparse
Check browser popup blockers

Getting Help

Check the browser console for errors
Review the validation test results
Ensure all dependencies are installed
Verify API endpoints are accessible

üßë‚Äçüíª For Developers
Adding New Databases

Add API client in backend/api_clients.py
Update synonym mappings in backend/synonym_resolver.py
Add harmonization rules in backend/harmonizer.py
Update frontend database list in components/QueryForm.js

Adding New Query Types
